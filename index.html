                        Students visited the Lab where research is being carried out on Zebra fish to study the impact of various human disorders and their treatment. They also visited the Labs of Biotechnology where they were familiarised with the research equipment such as Autoclaves in which the glass apparatus is sterilised under very high temperature and pressure, Centrifuge machines which use high velocity to separate components from solutions, Spectrophotometers which find optical densities of biological samples, Cold storage refrigerators and many more..
                        Students were also shown different kinds of microscopes including electron microscope.
                        The students, accompanied by Ph.D. scholars, were taken on a guided tour to have a glimpse of the facilities at IGIB. This Hands On workshop lent students a good exposure of the various areas of research and infra-structure available in these world class laboratories. In our country number of students pursuing research has seen a down fall in the recent times. These kind of visits surely encourage and motivate the school students to look towards research with a fresh perspective.</p>

It was an event organised to commemorate 150th birth anniversary of Father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi. It was simultaneously held at 5000 different locations across India and around 60 other countries. Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay along with MNRE organized this historical event. The Students learnt about how the global temperatures are constantly rising and its impacts on life. Earth Shoot Day i.e. the day of measuring sustainability in terms of the total resources produced by earth and their consumption was discussed in detail. Students were made aware of the fact that if same amount is consumed then there is balance but if the consumption exceeds that of production, then consumption is overshot. The consumption and generation of energy should have a holistic approach, so that it has no adverse implications on the Earth. In the year 2018-19 the Earth Shoot Day arrived in July itself instead in the month of December. Gandhiji’s words of wisdom were recalled that earth gives enough for every one’s need but not for every one’s greed. Relevance of the two Gandhian principles even today was discussed i.e. ’ Production by Masses and not mass production.</p>
